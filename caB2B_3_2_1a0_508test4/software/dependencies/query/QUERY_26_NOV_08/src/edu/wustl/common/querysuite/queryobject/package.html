<!--brief description of the Package here -->
Provides the interfaces used to represent a user-defined query.
<!-- Detailed Decription of the package -->
The topmost unit is the IQuery. 
It contains the constraints and the outputs.<br>
The constraints are a combination of expressions and a join graph; each expression belongs to a functional class, 
and contains rules/expressions connected by logical connectors. The join graph contains the associations 
between the expressions.<br>
The outputs are represented by a tree. There has to be atleast one functionalClass that is present in both,
the output tree and the joingraph, so that the output classes can be joined to the classes in the constraints.
