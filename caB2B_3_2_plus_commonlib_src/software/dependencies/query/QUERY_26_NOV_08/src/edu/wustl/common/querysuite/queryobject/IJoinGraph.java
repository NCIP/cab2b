/**
 * A rooted, directed acyclic graph with expressions as vertices, and
 * associations as edges.<br>
 * The graph will always contain all the expressions' ids (obtained from
 * {@link edu.wustl.common.querysuite.queryobject.IConstraints}) as vertices. The vertices
 * will be added to/removed from the joingraph as and when expressions are added
 * to/removed from
 * {@link edu.wustl.common.querysuite.queryobject.IConstraints}. The methods
 * in joingraph can only add/remove associations among the vertices. <br>
 * If v1 and v2 are two vertices, the direction will be v1->v2 if v2 is a
 * subexpression of v1. This user of the API will generally build the joingraph
 * based on metadata, and in cases of ambiguity, the user will help forming this
 * graph. <br>
 * This graph basically determines the join conditions in the query. e.g. for
 * each edge (v1, v2) between two vertices v1 and v2, there will be a join
 * between the functional classes of the expressions denoted by v1 and v2; and
 * the join condition is determined by the info in the
 * {@link edu.wustl.common.querysuite.queryobject.IAssociation}.
