1. ClientQueryBuilder is now the abstract ConstraintsObjectBuilder. 
	- caTissue can implement the abstract method to throw UnsupportedOperationException for now.
	- setOutputForQuery is not a part of this class (hence the rename)
	- cab2b's implementation should implement the abstract method and add methods for setting output.	
2. Logger statements (e.g. in ConstraintsObjectBuilder) commented.

3. Test cases to be moved from commonpackage.

API design (for Srinath only):
1. OuputTreeNode, OuputEntity, OuputAttribute... is it useless?
2. Check catissue's OutputTreeDataNode; might be useful.
